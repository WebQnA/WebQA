Hi all:

We realize that sometimes Eval.ai fails to communicate with our eval server. 
So, we provide a script for calling our eval server on your local computer. 
You're more than welcome to try this out!

```
from Call_WebQA_eval_server_locally import evaluate
evaluate("your_submission.json", "test")
```
